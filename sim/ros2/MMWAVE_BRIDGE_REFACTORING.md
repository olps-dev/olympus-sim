# mmWave ROS2 Bridge Refactoring

## Overview

The mmWave ROS2 Bridge has been completely refactored to improve maintainability, reliability, and modularity. This document explains the changes made and how to use the new implementation.

## Key Improvements

1. **Modular Structure**: The code has been split into logical modules:
   - Core ROS2 node functionality
   - Gazebo transport handling
   - PointCloud utilities
   - Logging and other utilities

2. **Improved Error Handling**: Each component has robust error handling to prevent crashes.

3. **Better Logging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the codebase to help diagnose issues.

4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: The bridge will automatically fall back to test data if Gazebo data is unavailable.

5. **Simplified Entry Point**: The main script is now a simple entry point that delegates to the modular components.

```

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Source ROS2
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

# Run the bridge
./launch_mmwave_bridge.py
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test with ROS2 only (no Gazebo)
./test_mmwave_bridge.py --test-mode ros2-only

# Test with Gazebo integration
./test_mmwave_bridge.py --test-mode with-gazebo
```

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo ./install_mmwave_bridge_deps.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If the bridge fails to connect to Gazebo:

1. Check if Gazebo is running with the mmWave sensor plugin
2. Verify the topic names match between Gazebo and the bridge
3. Run in test mode to verify ROS2 functionality
4. Check the logs for detailed error messages

## Next Steps

1. Add unit tests for each module
2. Implement configuration file support
3. Create a ROS2 launch file for integration with other nodes
4. Add visualization tools for debugging
